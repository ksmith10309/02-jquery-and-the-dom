## Overview
We want to build a blog site that pulls in data from a js file and populates our index.html

## Getting Started
User must fork repo from https://github.com/ksmith10309/02-jquery-and-the-dom
In order to add additional content to their blog they need to add content into blogArticles.js using the set parameters of the previously posted articles. Once they have completed their data entry the site will auto post their new article.

## Architecture

The application uses Javascript and jQuery to modify the DOM in order to publish blog content to the site. The application uses css to create a responsive site that changes the UX between desktop and mobile views using @media. 

JavaScript, jQuery, html, css.

## Change Log
